## Introduction
I came across this dataset on the forage website provided by KPMG. It contains a fictional company Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. The team at Sprocket needs help analyzing their data to find the best marketing strategy. 
The dataset contains 4 sheets;
•	Transactions
•	Customer demographic
•	Customer address 
•	New customer list

### Problem statement
---
- What is the best marketing strategy?
- How to boost sales.
- How to identify high value customers.

### Skills demonstrated
---
- Proper use of pivot tables
- Use of formulas 
- How to properly filter data
- Customer analysis

### Data Transformation/Cleaning
---
Starting with cleaning the data some of the steps included
1.	Transformed the datatype in the Product first date column from numeric to date.
2.	Matched the values in state and Gender columns
3.	Blank rows and columns such as default, Address and rank were filtered out.
Columns such has age and recency where added to the dataset for analysis. The lookup function was used to merge the datasets together after cleaning.

### Analysis and visualization
---
Looking at the wealth segment by age, we can se that the ages between 41-51 bring the most profit across all wealth segment.

Looking at RFM values across job industry where 1 is the lowest grade and 4 is the highest. In the Health sector they have a higher count for Frequency compared to other metrics as shown below

While in the Manufacturing sector while they have a higher count in Frequency their recency and Monetary value are not far off as shown below

### Conclusion and recommendation
---
Looking at the RFM values for the top 25%. In the Health sector we can assume that customers in this sector purchase from the brand frequently but aren’t necessarily big spenders. Therefore, we can encourage customers in this segment to purchase more by offering Vouchers and discounts.
